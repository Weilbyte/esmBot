# esmBot-min
A modified, stateless version of [esmBot](https://github.com/esmBot/esmBot/wiki/Setup). Meant to be run for a few servers only.

Main Changes:
* Only commands related to image manipulation (and some utility commands)
* No database (therefore no prefix per server)
* S3 Uploading (Uses S3 to upload files over 8MB - supports S3 compatible services that use v4 signature)
* No API server
